# Card Game

### ECM2414 Pair Coursework Project

This project is a threaded card game simulation, written in java. Our development is documented within the attached *Report.pdf*.

## Running the Test Suite

The test class files have been compiled into */Tests* , along with the supporting files for certain tests.
Extract this folder and add *cards.jar* to the directory.
Execute `java -cp "<junit-4.13.2.jar filepath>;<hamcrest-1.3.jar filepath>;." org.junit.runner.JUnitCore Tests.CardGameTestSuite` in this directory to run the test suite.
